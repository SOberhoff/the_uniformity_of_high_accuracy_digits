Dear Madam/Sir,

the following is a small but curious result I hit upon in my master's thesis a few months ago. I have heard from more than one professor that parts of my thesis might be worth publishing, I've just been putting it off. Indeed, there might be another full article worth of material in this thesis. But I've never published before so I figured it's better to take this in steps. 

I'm submitting to your journal because a) I enjoy writing somewhat informally and b) I'm not exactly doing cutting edge research mathematics here.

I hope you see the same elementary charm that I see in the result presented here.

Regards,\\
Sebastian Oberhoff
